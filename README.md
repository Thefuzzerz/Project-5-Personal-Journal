# Project-5-Personal-Journal

This is an application for the Treehouse Python Project 5 - Personal Journal. The application uses Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application allows users to create journal entries with details, title, date, what they learned, what resources to remember, and tags. Users are able to create entries once registered with the application.

A default account has been created to pass registration for testing with the username - Admin, password - treehouse.

A dependency Pipfile can be found in the repository.
Peewee Models can be found for both Users and Entries.
Created 2 different listing pages - One to show all recent journal entries - One to display current user's entries.
Users are able to view all tags or specific tags and their related journals.
Detail view available for each journal entry. 
Editing and deletion of entry availabe but only for owner of entry.
Routes use slugs instead of IDs for details, entry, and deletion.

I still require further understanding of Unit Testing, only able to acheive 20% coverage. Tested application manually.
